#Licensing

##Code
#####Exercise: read the Wikipedia articles on Apache, BSD, and MIT licenses. Describe the similarities and the differences.

similarities:
* No software warranty
* Commercial Use Allowed
* no specification the territory for which the license is granted
* all of them are permissive licenses with minimal restrictions on reuse and redistribution
* author's name

differences:
* Apache License has several versions / only one MIT license / BSD is a family of BSD-like licenses
* Patent rights allowed, Modified files must be marked / Apache only
* MIT license can be relicensed under GPL

## ART

#####Exercise: Pick a creative work (or make up a fictional one); come up with three obviously non-commercial uses of this work.

Stonehenge Stones

* the use of images in books and articles
* digitization of the cast for further research copies of the cast
* Excursions and lectures on the history 

#####Exercise: Now argue that all three of these uses are commercial.

* a copy can be used as a souvenir product
* lectures and author's excursions can be paid


###Data

#####Exercise: What is the effect on science reproducibility if the data set is not liberally licensed?

The owners of the data have the ability to control their distribution as long as other researchers request a license. Open data are disseminated uncontrolled

#####Exercise: give an example of a proprietary data source; what could you do with that data if it were liberally licensed?

A collection of books from a famous museum or university, in which you can learn not only historical facts and mysteries, 
but also the peculiarities of language or documents however. Not all books are available for use on the grounds of fragility or secrecy
